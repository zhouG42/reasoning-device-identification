To get the list of all Research Assistants in Offices and the Lights they own, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the Research Assistants in the knowledge graph.
2. For each Research Assistant, find the Office they are located in.
3. For each Office, find the Lights that are contained in that Office.
4. Combine the information about the Research Assistants, their Offices, and the Lights in those Offices.

Step 1: Identify all the Research Assistants in the knowledge graph.
The knowledge graph states that the following people have the job title "Research Assistant":
- :Daniel
- :Zhou
- :Sebastian
- :Micheal
- :Thomas

Step 2: For each Research Assistant, find the Office they are located in.
:Daniel's work location is <#4-441>
:Zhou's work location is <#4-443>
:Sebastian's work location is <#4-444>
:Micheal's work location is <#4-436>
:Thomas's work location is <#3-334>

Step 3: For each Office, find the Lights that are contained in that Office.
<#4-441> contains the following Lights:
- <http://example.com/td/td4>
- <http://example.com/td/td20>

<#4-443> contains the following Lights:
- <http://example.com/td/td2>
- <http://example.com/td/td18>
- <http://example.com/td/td38>

<#4-444> contains the following Lights:

<#4-436> does not contain any Lights.

<#3-334> contains the following Lights:
- <http://example.com/td/td5>
- <http://example.com/td/td21>

Step 4: Combine the information about the Research Assistants, their Offices, and the Lights in those Offices.
- person: :Daniel, device: <http://example.com/td/td4>, <http://example.com/td/td20>
- person: :Zhou, device: <http://example.com/td/td2>, <http://example.com/td/td18>, <http://example.com/td/td38>

To get the list of all External PhD Students in Offices and the Lights they own, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the External PhD Students in the knowledge graph.
2. Identify the Offices they are located in.
3. Find the Lights that are contained in those Offices and are marked as personal devices.

Step 1: Identify the External PhD Students in the knowledge graph.
The knowledge graph states that the following people have the job title "External PhD Student":
- :Tim
- :Marco
- :Rene

Step 2: Identify the Offices they are located in.
The knowledge graph states the work locations of the External PhD Students:
- :Tim is located in <#4-442>
- :Marco is located in <#3-331>
- :Rene is located in <#3-333>

All of these locations are of type :Office.

Step 3: Find the Lights that are contained in those Offices and are marked as personal devices.
The knowledge graph states the following Lights in the relevant Offices:
- <#4-442> contains <http://example.com/td/td35>, which is a :LedStrip and is marked as a personal device.
- <#3-331> contains no personal Lights.
- <#3-333> contains <http://example.com/td/td37>, which is a :Radio and is marked as a personal device.

Therefore, the final result is:

- person: :Tim, device: <http://example.com/td/td35>
- person: :Rene, device: <http://example.com/td/td37>
