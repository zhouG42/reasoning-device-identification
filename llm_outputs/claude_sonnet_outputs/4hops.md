### 4_1: person -> filter(RA) -> place -> device -> filter(Light) (Question:  give me a list of all Research Assistants and the Lights they own.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll analyze the knowledge graph to find all Research Assistants and their associated lights by checking their work locations and the lights in those locations.

Research Assistants and their lights:

1. Daniel (Research Assistant)
   - Work location: #4-441
   - Light: td4 (MAC: xx4)

2. Zhou (Research Assistant)
   - Work location: #4-443
   - Light: td2 (MAC: xx2)

3. Sebastian (Research Assistant)
   - Work location: #4-444
   - Light: td1 (MAC: xx1)

4. Micheal (Research Assistant)
   - Work location: #4-436
   - Light: td15 (MAC: xx15)

5. Thomas (Research Assistant)
   - Work location: #3-334
   - Light: td5 (MAC: xx5)

Each Research Assistant has one light in their office, and all these lights except for the one in the IoT Lab (Micheal's location) are marked as personal devices.

### 4_2: person -> filter(RA) -> room -> filter(office) -> device (Question: give me a list of all All Research Assistants and Devices they have in Office.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll help you find all Research Assistants and the devices in their offices. Let me analyze the data:

Research Assistants and their devices:

1. Daniel (Room #4-441):
- Light (personal device)
- Heater

2. Zhou (Room #4-443):
- Light (personal device)
- Heater
- Kettle (personal device)

3. Sebastian (Room #4-444):
- Light (personal device)
- Heater

4. Micheal (Room #4-436):
- Light
- Lock
- AC

5. Thomas (Room #3-334):
- Light (personal device)
- Heater

All these Research Assistants have at least a light and heating system in their offices. Some have additional devices:
- Zhou has a personal kettle
- Micheal's office (which is the IoT Lab) has additional devices like a lock and AC system

Note that while Micheal's devices are in the IoT Lab rather than a standard office, I included them since he's listed as a Research Assistant with that work location.

2. Zhou (Room #4-443)
3. Sebastian (Room #4-444)
4. Micheal (Room #4-436)
5. Thomas (Room #3-334)

Their devices in their respective offices:

Daniel (#4-441):
- Light (td4) - Personal device
- Heater (td20)

Zhou (#4-443):
- Light (td2) - Personal device
- Heater (td18)
- Kettle (td38) - Personal device

Sebastian (#4-444):
- Light (td1) - Personal device
- Heater (td17)

Micheal (#4-436 - IoT Lab):
- Light (td15) [O]
- Lock (td28) [O]
- AC (td31) [O]

Thomas (#3-334):
- Light (td5) - Personal device
- Heater (td21)

Each office typically has a personal light and a heater, with some additional devices in certain rooms. The IoT Lab where Micheal works has different equipment due to its nature as a laboratory space.

    - Light with MAC address "xx5"

11. Layla (Room #4-443):
    - Light with MAC address "xx2" (shares office with Zhou)

Each person has access to at least one light in their office, and in some cases (like Zhou and Layla who share an office), they have access to the same light.

### 4_5: storey -> filter(4th) -> room -> device -> filter(Light) (Question: give me a list of all All Lights contained in Storey 4.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll help you find all the lights contained in Storey 4. Let me analyze the spaces in Storey 4 and their contained lights.

Storey 4 contains these spaces:
- WiSo 4.444
- WiSo 4.443
- WiSo 4.442
- WiSo 4.441
- WiSo 4.436 (IoT Lab)
- WiSo 4.435 (Meeting Room)

The lights in these spaces are:

1. Room 4.444: <http://example.com/td/td1>
2. Room 4.443: <http://example.com/td/td2>
3. Room 4.442: <http://example.com/td/td3>
4. Room 4.441: <http://example.com/td/td4>
5. Room 4.436 (IoT Lab): <http://example.com/td/td15>
6. Room 4.435 (Meeting Room): <http://example.com/td/td16>

So there are 6 lights total on Storey 4. Note that lights td1-td4 are marked as personal devices, while td15 and td16 are not personal devices.
